# CSS helpers â€” the library of CSS classes that you could use in every web user interface

## What is it?

Always for every project I need to create classes for elements that don't refer to visual elements and apply in specific environments. For example, the classes to hide element that are created for screen readers. I'm tired of copy-pasting and so I make this library.
